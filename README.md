 # 1. A Quick Reference Guide to the Action Framework's Three-Step Iterative Process: A Strategic Framework for Prompt Engineering

Welcome to the Quick Reference Guide to the Action Framework's Three-Step Iterative Process. This guide is your straightforward route to interact with AI language models and optimize your questions and requests.
# 2. Python script that describes how one might interact with a language model using the Action Framework approach. 
This is a generalized script, the actual interaction would depend on the specific application and the actual language model you're using

# 3. Report Action Framework Tutorials Project
# Conclusion
The development of the Action Framework Tutorials was a highly challenging and enriching project. It entailed understanding the complexities of Large Language Models, formulating clear, effective prompts, and integrating ethical AI practices. Despite the challenges faced, the project's outcome was a comprehensive, user-friendly guide that demystified interacting with AI models, empowering users to use AI more effectively and responsibly.

# 5. Update Action_Framework_Breakdown Example + Enhancements ( User Testing, Collect Feedback, Iterative Refinement)
This updated Action Framework code will allow users to input their parameters in a more structured and detailed manner, which should result in more accurate and useful outputs from the AI model. ( User Testing, Collect Feedback, Iterative Refinement)

Remember to replace the placeholders in the action_framework dictionary with your specific guidelines, and replace "What is your actual prompt here?" with your actual prompt in the final print statement. The triple slashes "///" denote the start and end of the prompt architecture.
