        {
            "title": "Brainstorm Ideas",
            "description": "Begin by brainstorming to explore various ideas and directions. This helps in generating creative and effective prompts.",
            "reason": "Because having options gives you the flexibility to choose the most effective approach."
        },
        {
            "title": "Define the Action",
            "description": "Select a key action word to guide the language model.",
            "reason": "This sets a clear expectation and helps in receiving a more focused response."
        },
        {
            "title": "Set the Context",
            "description": "Define the purpose, audience, or situation to guide the model.",
            "reason": "It helps in tailoring the response to be more relevant and suitable for the intended purpose."
        },
        {
            "title": "Prioritize",
            "description": "Outline the desired tone, style, and specific elements.",
            "reason": "To guide the model in how the information should be presented, ensuring alignment with the desired communication strategy."
        },
        {
            "title": "Craft the Initial Prompt Text",
            "description": "Combine action, context, and priorities into a single prompt.",
            "reason": "To provide a cohesive instruction for the language model to process."
        },
        {
            "title": "Evaluate the Model’s Response",
            "description": "Critically evaluate the response against the priorities set.",
            "reason": "To identify areas where the response deviated from expectations."
        },
        {
            "title": "Refine Through Iteration",
            "description": "Refine your prompt if the model’s response is not satisfactory.",
            "reason": "Because prompt engineering is often an iterative process."
        },
        {
            "title": "Set Expectations & Understand Limitations",
            "description": "Understand the limitations of language models and set realistic expectations.",
            "reason": "Because language models are not perfect and it’s important to recognize their boundaries to obtain meaningful results."
        },
        {
            "title": "Use Examples and Counterexamples",
            "description": "In some cases, provide examples or counterexamples to further guide the model.",
            "reason": "Because sometimes language models need additional direction to understand complex or nuanced requests."
        },
        {
            "title": "Test with Different Examples",
            "description": "Validate the effectiveness of your prompt with different scenarios.",
            "reason": "To ensure it consistently produces the desired output."
        },
        {
            "title": "Embed Ethics and Responsible AI Usage",
            "description": "Ensure that your prompt and the model's response align with ethical standards.",
            "reason": "To foster responsible AI usage which respects human values and avoids harm."
        },
        {
            "title": "Document the Final Prompt",
            "description": "Save the final version of the prompt for future reference.",
            "reason": "To create a repository of effective prompts for similar tasks."
        },
        {
            "title": "Reflect on the Process",
            "description": "Take time to reflect on the entire process and what you learned.",
            "reason": "This deepens your understanding and prepares you for future engagements with language models."
        }
    ],
    "conclusion": "This enhanced Action Framework combines classic prompt engineering strategies with an ethical backbone and advanced optimizations. Remember that engaging with language models is an iterative and responsible practice. Keep refining your approach, stay mindful of ethics, and you’ll be crafting effective prompts responsibly."
