# Import necessary libraries
# For the sake of this example, let's assume we are using the OpenAI API
import openai

# Set up OpenAI API
openai.api_key = 'your-api-key'

# Action Framework Training - 

# Module 1: Data-Informed Planning
# Objective: Determine what you want the AI language model to do

# Define your prompt
prompt = "Translate the following English text to French: 'Hello, how are you?'"

# Module 2: Prioritization and Prompting
# Objective: Guide the language model through your request

# Set your language model settings. For example, you might choose a specific model,
# set a temperature parameter to control randomness, and limit the response length.
model_settings = {
    "engine": "text-davinci-002",
    "temperature": 0.5,
    "max_tokens": 60
}

# Module 3: Evaluation and Iterative Refinement
# Objective: Evaluate the language model's output and refine your instructions

# Send your request to the language model
response = openai.Completion.create(
  engine=model_settings["engine"],
  prompt=prompt,
  temperature=model_settings["temperature"],
  max_tokens=model_settings["max_tokens"]
)

# Evaluate the response
print(response.choices[0].text.strip())

# Depending on the results, you may need to go back and adjust your prompt or your model settings.
# This is the iterative refinement part of the Action Framework.
